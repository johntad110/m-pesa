## Installation

Install the SDK using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install mpesa-sdk
```

or

```bash
yarn add mpesa-sdk
```

---

## Configuration

Create an instance of the SDK by providing the required configuration:

```typescript
import { MPesa } from 'mpesa-sdk';

const mpesa = MPesa.getInstance({
    environment: 'sandbox', // 'sandbox' or 'production'
    apiKey: 'your-api-key',
    secretKey: 'your-secret-key',
    timeout: 7000, // Optional, default is 5000 ms
    retries: 3,    // Optional, default is 3
    logLevel: 'verbose', // Optional, 'none', 'error', or 'verbose'
});
```

---

## Authentication

Authentication is handled automatically by the SDK. Tokens are generated and cached internally. You donâ€™t need to call the authentication endpoint directly.

---

## API Methods

### 1. STK Push (Customer Initiated Payments)

Facilitates payments initiated by customers.

#### Example:

```typescript
const response = await mpesa.stkPush({
    BusinessShortCode: '123456',
    Password: 'your-password',
    Timestamp: '20250101120000',
    TransactionType: 'CustomerPayBillOnline',
    Amount: 100,
    PartyA: '254700123456',
    PartyB: '123456',
    PhoneNumber: '254700123456',
    CallBackURL: 'https://your-callback-url.com',
    AccountReference: 'Ref123',
    TransactionDesc: 'Payment Description',
});

console.log('STK Push Response:', response);
```

#### Response:
```json
{
  "ResponseCode": "0",
  "ResponseDescription": "Success. Request accepted for processing",
  "CustomerMessage": "Success. Request accepted for processing"
}
```

---

### 2. Register C2B URL

Register validation and confirmation URLs for receiving customer payments.

#### Example:

```typescript
const response = await mpesa.registerC2BUrl({
    ShortCode: '101010',
    ResponseType: 'Completed',
    CommandID: 'RegisterURL',
    ConfirmationURL: 'https://yourdomain.com/c2b/confirmation',
    ValidationURL: 'https://yourdomain.com/c2b/validation',
});

console.log('C2B URL Registration Response:', response);
```

#### Response:
```json
{
  "responseCode": 200,
  "responseMessage": "Request processed successfully",
  "customerMessage": "Request processed successfully"
}
```

---

### 3. B2C Payments (Business to Customer)

Send payments from businesses to customers.

#### Example:

```typescript
const response = await mpesa.b2cPayment({
    InitiatorName: 'testapi',
    SecurityCredential: 'your-security-credential',
    CommandID: 'BusinessPayment',
    PartyA: '101010',
    PartyB: '254700123456',
    Remarks: 'Test B2C',
    Amount: 100,
    QueueTimeOutURL: 'https://yourdomain.com/b2c/timeout',
    ResultURL: 'https://yourdomain.com/b2c/result',
    Occassion: 'Disbursement', // Optional
});

console.log('B2C Payment Response:', response);
```

#### Response:
```json
{
  "ResponseCode": "0",
  "ResponseDescription": "Accept the service request successfully."
}
```

---

## Error Handling

The SDK provides centralized error management. Common errors are classified, and detailed error messages are returned.

#### Example:
```typescript
try {
    const response = await mpesa.stkPush(payload);
} catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error.message);
}
```

---

## Logging

Configure the logging level using the `logLevel` option:

- `none`: No logs.
- `error`: Logs errors only.
- `verbose`: Logs all requests, responses, and errors.

#### Example:
```typescript
const mpesa = MPesa.getInstance({
    environment: 'sandbox',
    apiKey: 'your-api-key',
    secretKey: 'your-secret-key',
    logLevel: 'verbose',
});
```

---
